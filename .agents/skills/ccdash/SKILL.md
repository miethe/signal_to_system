name: ccdash
description: Drive the standalone CCDash CLI from natural language to answer questions about project status, feature forensics, agent sessions, workflow failures, and after-action reports. Use when the operator or another agent asks about CCDash project health, agent-session analytics ("why did FEAT-X take so long", "what sessions ran for this feature", "which workflows are failing"), wants an AAR / narrative feature report, or needs help installing / authenticating the `ccdash` CLI against a target server. Routes intent to `ccdash` subcommands with the right `--output` mode, echoes provenance IDs for chaining, and degrades gracefully through `ccdash doctor` on transport/auth failures. Do not use for unrelated coding tasks, writing UI components, or anything outside CCDash project/session intelligence.

# ccdash Skill

A thin natural-language router over the standalone `ccdash` CLI. The CLI is authoritative; this skill decides which subcommand to run, which `--output` mode to pick, and how to chain calls using provenance IDs.

## When To Use

Trigger on intents such as:

- "What's the state of this project?" / "project status" / "project summary"
- "Why did FEAT-X take so long?" / "retrospective on FEAT-X" / "AAR for FEAT-X"
- "Which workflows are failing?" / "failure burden" / "flaky workflows"
- "Show sessions for FEAT-X" / "search session transcripts for Y" / "drilldown sentiment on session Z"
- "Install ccdash" / "set up ccdash against staging" / "log in to the staging target"
- Connectivity / auth error messages mentioning `ccdash`, `CCDASH_TARGET`, or an HTTP failure against a CCDash server.

## When NOT To Use

- General coding tasks unrelated to CCDash observability (building UI, editing backend code, unrelated debugging).
- Questions about other CLIs or platforms even if phrased as "project status" (e.g. Linear, GitHub, Vercel).
- Authoring new CCDash reports, workflows, or analytics queries — this skill only invokes existing commands.
- MCP tool invocation — deferred until the CCDash MCP surface ships; see the parent enablement plan (Phase 4 of this skill).

## Preflight (run once per session on uncertainty)

```bash
ccdash --version            # verify install; if missing -> recipes/target-onboarding.md
ccdash target show          # confirm active target + auth mode
```

If `ccdash` is not on PATH or `target show` errors: follow `recipes/target-onboarding.md`.
If a subsequent command returns a connection or 401/403 error: follow `recipes/unreachable-server.md` before surfacing the raw error.

## Routing

The authoritative intent -> command map lives in `scripts/router-table.json`. Load it for disambiguation; the summary below is a lossy render kept for quick scanning.

| Intent | Command | Default `--output` | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project status | `ccdash status project` | `json` (agent) / `human` (operator) | `references/command-status.md` |
| Doctor / diagnose | `ccdash doctor` | `human` | `references/command-doctor.md` |
| Install / onboard | `pipx install ccdash-cli`, then `target add` | `human` | `references/install-setup.md` |
| Target management | `ccdash target {list,add,use,show,remove,login,logout,set-token,check}` | `human` | `references/command-target.md` |
| Workflow failures | `ccdash workflow failures` | `json` | `references/command-workflow.md` |
| Feature list / show / sessions / documents | `ccdash feature {list,show,sessions,documents}` | `json` | `references/command-feature.md` |
| Session list / show / search / drilldown / family | `ccdash session {list,show,search,drilldown,family}` | `json` | `references/command-session.md` |
| AAR / narrative report | `ccdash report {aar,feature}` | `markdown` | `references/command-report.md` |

Output-mode decision rules live in `references/output-modes.md`. Provenance fields to echo back into agent context live in `references/provenance.md`.

## Multi-Step Flows (Recipes)

Multi-step investigations use deterministic recipes in `recipes/`:

- `recipes/project-triage.md` — `status project` -> risky feature -> `feature show` -> `feature sessions`.
- `recipes/feature-retrospective.md` — `feature show` -> `feature sessions` -> `report aar`.
- `recipes/workflow-failure-rootcause.md` — `workflow failures` -> pick workflow -> `session drilldown --concern`.
- `recipes/session-cluster-investigation.md` — `session show` -> `session family` -> drilldown each sibling.
- `recipes/unreachable-server.md` — transport/auth failure interpretation via `ccdash doctor`.
- `recipes/target-onboarding.md` — fresh operator: install -> `target add` -> `target login` -> `doctor`.

Prefer a recipe whenever the user's intent requires more than a single subcommand call. Single-command intents route directly via the table above.

## Output Mode Quick Rule

- Commands consumed **by the agent for reasoning**: `--output json` (or the `--json` shortcut).
- Commands rendered **verbatim to the user as narrative**: `--output markdown` (or `--md`). Defaults for `report aar` and `report feature`.
- Commands an **operator runs in a terminal** (target management, doctor): default `human`.

Full rules: `references/output-modes.md`.

## Provenance (always echo)

For every command result used in reasoning, surface the stable IDs and timestamps listed in `references/provenance.md` into the agent's working context so follow-up calls can chain without re-fetching.

## Graceful Degradation

Any transport/auth error (connection refused, DNS, TLS, 401/403, 5xx) MUST route through `ccdash doctor` before being surfaced as a raw error. See `recipes/unreachable-server.md`.

## Extending The Skill

When a new `ccdash` subcommand ships, do not edit this file. Follow the update protocol in the implementation plan (Update Protocol section):

1. Add/extend `references/command-<group>.md`.
2. Append a row to `scripts/router-table.json`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

Edit `SKILL.md` only if trigger scope or when-not-to-use guidance changes.
