# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

**Plan ID**: `IMPL-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{FEATURE-NAME}`
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: [Implementation Planner Agent]
**Human Brief**: [path to human brief, or "N/A — not created (feature too small)"]
**Related Documents**:
- **PRD**: `/docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md`
- **ADRs**: [Links to relevant Architecture Decision Records]

**Complexity**: [Small | Medium | Large | XL]
**Total Estimated Effort**: [Total story points]
**Target Timeline**: [Start date] - [End date]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences describing the implementation approach, key milestones, and success criteria]

## Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Sequence

Following MeatyPrompts layered architecture:
1. **Database Layer** - Tables, indexes, RLS policies
2. **Repository Layer** - DB I/O, transactions, cursor pagination
3. **Service Layer** - Business logic, DTOs, validation
4. **API Layer** - FastAPI routers, endpoints, OpenAPI docs
5. **UI Layer** - React components from @miethe/ui
6. **Testing Layer** - Unit, integration, E2E
7. **Documentation Finalization** - CHANGELOG, README, context, guides
8. **Deployment Layer** - Feature flags, monitoring, rollout

### Parallel Work Opportunities

[Identify tasks that can be done in parallel to optimize timeline]

### Critical Path

[Identify the critical path that determines overall timeline]

### Phase Summary

At-a-glance view of every phase with point estimates, target subagents, and model/platform designations. Keep this table in sync with the detailed phase breakdowns below — it is the canonical orchestration index for executors.

| Phase | Title | Estimate | Target Subagent(s) | Model(s) | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Database Foundation | X pts | data-layer-expert | sonnet | — |
| 2 | Repository Layer | X pts | python-backend-engineer, data-layer-expert | sonnet | — |
| 3 | Service Layer | X pts | python-backend-engineer, backend-architect | sonnet | — |
| 4 | API Layer | X pts | python-backend-engineer, backend-architect | sonnet | — |
| 5 | UI Layer | X pts | ui-engineer-enhanced, frontend-developer, ui-designer | sonnet (+ gemini-3.1-pro for design) | External model for UI-001 wireframing |
| 6 | Testing Layer | X pts | testing specialists, all developers | sonnet | — |
| 7 | Documentation Finalization | X pts | changelog-generator, documentation-writer, ai-artifacts-engineer | haiku (sonnet for skill SPECs) | — |
| 8 | Deployment Layer | X pts | DevOps, lead-pm | sonnet | — |
| **Total** | — | **X pts** | — | — | — |

**Model column conventions:**
- Claude-only phases: list the single Claude model (e.g., `sonnet`, `haiku`).
- Mixed phases: list the primary Claude model plus any external model in parens (e.g., `sonnet (+ gemini-3.1-pro for UI-001)`).
- External-heavy phases: list external model first with Claude as fallback.
- Reference `.claude/skills/planning/references/multi-model-guidance.md` for routing logic.

> Estimation rationale lives in the Human Brief (see §Estimation Sanity Check). Plan retains per-phase task estimates only.

## Deferred Items & In-Flight Findings Policy

### Deferred Items

Deferred items are tasks or features intentionally pushed to a future phase, a backlog, or held pending further research before implementation. They are distinct from scope cuts — they represent work the team acknowledges and plans to track.

**Rule**: Every deferred item MUST have a corresponding design-spec authoring task in the final phase (Documentation Finalization, DOC-006). The resulting design-spec path is appended to `deferred_items_spec_refs` in this plan's frontmatter.

#### Deferred Items Triage Table

| Item ID | Category | Reason Deferred | Trigger for Promotion | Target Spec Path |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| — | — | — | — | — |

*Populate during planning. Categories: `research-needed`, `scope-cut`, `backlog`, `spike-needed`, `dependency-blocked`.*

### In-Flight Findings

Findings are discoveries made during execution: plan/reality mismatches, unexpected bugs or gotchas, schema gaps, or constraints not visible at planning time.

**Lazy-creation rule**: The findings doc is NOT pre-created. Create it only on the FIRST real finding (this should be rare). Path: `.claude/findings/[feature-slug]-findings.md`.

**On creation**:
1. Set `findings_doc_ref` in this plan's frontmatter to the new path
2. Append the path to `related_documents`
3. If the finding is load-bearing (affects scope, architecture, or acceptance criteria), add a new design-spec authoring task row (DOC-006) in the Documentation Finalization phase and append the resulting spec path to `deferred_items_spec_refs`

### Quality Gate

The final phase (Documentation Finalization) cannot be sealed until:
- All deferred items have a design-spec path in `deferred_items_spec_refs`, OR are explicitly marked N/A with rationale in the triage table
- If `findings_doc_ref` is populated: findings doc finalized and status advanced from `draft` → `accepted`

### Phase 7: Documentation Finalization

**Duration**: 0.5-1 day
**Dependencies**: All implementation phases complete
**Assigned Subagent(s)**: changelog-generator, documentation-writer

#### Overview

Evaluate and update all documentation affected by this feature. All doc tasks delegate to skill-equipped agents. Docs should be concise and usage-focused, not verbose. Context files follow progressive disclosure (CLAUDE.md pointers only, detail in key-context).

#### Required Evaluation Areas

| Area | When to Include | Delegation Target |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| CHANGELOG.md | User-facing changes (new features, breaking changes, deprecations) | `changelog-generator` agent |
| README.md | Features, CLI commands, screenshots, or version changed | `documentation-writer` agent |
| User/dev docs | New features or changed behavior that users need to know about | `documentation-writer` agent |
| Context files | Changes affect agent behavior, architectural patterns, or dev workflow | `documentation-writer` agent |
| Project-level custom skills | Changes affect domain of a custom skill (CLI commands, capabilities, workflows) | `ai-artifacts-engineer` (SPEC/SKILL) + `documentation-writer` (workflows) |

#### Context File Update Rules

- **CLAUDE.md** (root or nested): Pointer layer only — add one-liner + path reference, ≤3 lines per addition
- **Key-context files** (`.claude/context/key-context/`): Detail lives here — update existing files, create new only when genuinely needed
- **Rules** (`.claude/rules/`): Update when invariants change

#### Task Table

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Subagent(s) | Model | Effort | Dependencies |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| DOC-001 | Update CHANGELOG | Add entry for user-facing changes under `[Unreleased]` following Keep A Changelog format. Categorization rules and skip patterns are in `.claude/specs/changelog-spec.md`. Skip this task (set `changelog_required: false` in plan frontmatter) only when the feature has zero user-facing changes. Agent must verify that `[Unreleased]` contains an entry matching this feature before the release gate. | Entry exists under `[Unreleased]` with correct categorization; `changelog_ref` frontmatter set to `CHANGELOG.md` | 0.5 pts | changelog-generator | haiku | adaptive | All impl phases |
| DOC-002 | Update README | Rebuild README if features/CLI/screenshots/version changed | README reflects current state | 0.5 pts | documentation-writer | haiku | adaptive | All impl phases |
| DOC-003 | Update user/dev docs | Update relevant docs under `docs/` for changed behavior | Docs accurate and concise | 0.5-1 pts | documentation-writer | haiku | adaptive | All impl phases |
| DOC-004 | Update context files | Update CLAUDE.md, key-context, rules for agent-relevant changes | Additions follow progressive disclosure | 0.5-1 pts | documentation-writer | haiku | adaptive | All impl phases |
| DOC-005 | Update plan frontmatter | Set status=completed, populate commit_refs, files_affected, updated | Frontmatter complete per lifecycle spec | 0.5 pts | documentation-writer | haiku | adaptive | DOC-001 through DOC-004 |
| DOC-006 | Author design specs for deferred items | For each item in the "Deferred Items" triage table, author a design_spec at `docs/project_plans/design-specs/[item-slug].md` with `maturity: shaping` (or `idea` if research/SPIKE needed), set `prd_ref` to the parent PRD, and append the resulting path to this plan's `deferred_items_spec_refs`. Skip with "N/A — no deferred items" if the triage table is empty. | All deferred items have corresponding design_specs OR documented as N/A | 0.5-2 pts | documentation-writer | sonnet | medium | All impl phases |
| DOC-007 | Finalize findings doc & promote load-bearing findings | If `findings_doc_ref` is populated: ensure all phase findings captured, advance status from `draft` → `accepted`, populate `promoted_to` with this plan's path. For any load-bearing findings, ensure a design_spec was authored (coordinate with DOC-006). Skip with "N/A — no findings captured" if `findings_doc_ref` is null. | Findings doc finalized OR marked N/A | 0.5-1 pts | documentation-writer | haiku | low | DOC-006 |
| DOC-008 | Update affected project-level skills | For each custom skill whose domain is touched by this plan (check `.claude/specs/skills-index.md`): update SPEC.md Capability Coverage matrix, bump SPEC.md Changelog + `updated` date, refresh affected workflow files, update skills-index.md version if bumped. Skip with "N/A — no project-level skill domains affected" if none apply. | All affected custom skills have current SPEC.md + workflows, OR documented as N/A | 0.5-2 pts | ai-artifacts-engineer, documentation-writer | sonnet | medium | All impl phases |

**Phase 7 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section contains an entry matching this feature (required if `changelog_required: true`; verify via `.claude/specs/changelog-spec.md` before release gate)
- [ ] README updated (if applicable)
- [ ] User/dev docs updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Context files updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Plan frontmatter complete
- [ ] Design specs authored for all deferred items (or N/A with rationale)
- [ ] Findings doc finalized if any findings captured during execution
- [ ] Project-level custom skills updated (or N/A with rationale)
- [ ] `deferred_items_spec_refs` and `findings_doc_ref` frontmatter populated

### Phase 8: Deployment Layer

**Duration**: [X days]
**Dependencies**: All phases complete
**Assigned Subagent(s)**: DevOps, lead-pm

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Subagent(s) | Model | Effort | Dependencies |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------|--------|--------------|

**Phase 8 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Feature flags working
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Production rollout completed
- [ ] Post-launch metrics healthy

---

## Wrap-Up: Feature Guide & PR

**Triggered**: Automatically after the final implementation phase is sealed (all phase quality gates pass). This is NOT a separate numbered phase — it is a post-implementation close-out step.

### Step 1 — Feature Guide

Delegate to `documentation-writer` (haiku) to create `.claude/worknotes/<feature-slug>/feature-guide.md`.

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
doc_type: feature_guide
feature_slug: "<feature-slug>"
prd_ref: <path to parent PRD>
plan_ref: <path to this implementation plan>
spike_ref: <spike path if any, else null>
adr_refs: []   # populate from plan frontmatter
created: <today>
---
```

**Required sections** (keep total under 200 lines):
1. **What Was Built** — 2-4 sentences: the core capability delivered and why
2. **Architecture Overview** — key files/layers touched; link to ADRs for decisions
3. **How to Test** — per-edition instructions (local + enterprise where applicable); include CLI commands or API calls
4. **Test Coverage Summary** — brief statement of what is covered and at what level
5. **Known Limitations** — items deferred or deliberately out of scope

**Audience**: Developer/stakeholder reference now; future supplement to CHANGELOG for users who want more detail than a changelog entry provides.

Commit the feature guide before opening the PR.

### Step 2 — Open PR

After the feature guide is committed, open the pull request:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<concise feature title (≤70 chars)>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
- <bullet 3>

## Feature Guide
.claude/worknotes/<feature-slug>/feature-guide.md

## Test plan
- [ ] All unit + integration tests pass
- [ ] Smoke-tested locally (local edition)
- [ ] Smoke-tested in enterprise stack (if applicable)

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
EOF
)"
```

Derive the PR summary bullets directly from the implementation plan's Executive Summary and the CHANGELOG entry authored in Documentation Finalization.

---

## Model & Effort Assignment

All tasks in the phase breakdowns include **Model** and **Effort** columns:

### Model Column

The Model column specifies which AI model executes the task. Reference `.claude/config/multi-model.toml` for available models and capabilities.

**Default Models:**
- **`sonnet`** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) - Default for implementation, code changes, testing, and architectural decisions
- **`haiku`** (Claude 3.5 Haiku) - Default for documentation, exploration, simple queries, and mechanical tasks
- **`gemini-3.1-pro`** - For design/wireframing, web research, complex UI workflows, multi-modal analysis
- **`nano-banana-pro`** - For image generation and image-specific tasks
- **`gpt-5.3-codex`** - For escalation after 2+ failed Claude cycles or when specialist debug expertise is needed

### Effort Column

The Effort column specifies how much reasoning/thinking the model should apply. Valid values:

- **`adaptive`** (default) - Model uses adaptive thinking based on task complexity
- **`low`** - Minimal reasoning, straightforward execution
- **`medium`** - Moderate reasoning for moderate complexity
- **`high`** - Extended reasoning for complex problems
- **`xhigh`** - Maximum reasoning for highly complex/novel problems

Reference `.claude/config/multi-model.toml` § `[models.effort_levels]` for detailed guidance on each level.

**Note**: For Claude models, effort translates to extended thinking budget. For external models (Gemini, Codex), effort maps to their native reasoning parameters.
