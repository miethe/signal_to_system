  Generate and optimize PRDs, Implementation Plans, and Progress Tracking
  documents optimized as AI artifacts for development agents. Use when
  creating new feature plans, breaking down long planning docs (>800 lines),
  or setting up progress tracking. Supports: 1) Create PRD from feature
  request, 2) Create Implementation Plan from PRD with phase breakdown and
  subagent assignments, 3) Optimize existing plans by breaking into
  phase-specific files, 4) Create progress tracking with task assignments.
  Example: "Create a PRD for user authentication feature" or "Break down the
  sidebar-polish implementation plan into phase files" or "Create progress
  tracking for data-layer-fixes PRD".

# Planning Skill

## About This Skill

The Planning Skill generates and optimizes Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Implementation Plans as AI artifacts - file-based context caches optimized for AI agent consumption rather than human reading.

### Purpose

- Generate comprehensive PRDs from feature requests following MP template
- Create phased Implementation Plans with subagent task assignments
- Optimize existing planning docs by breaking into token-efficient files
- Set up progress tracking structures for multi-phase implementations

### Key Benefits

- **Token Efficiency**: Max ~800 lines per file for optimal AI context loading
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary → Detail pattern with linked files
- **Subagent Integration**: Automatic task assignment to appropriate specialists
- **MP Architecture Compliance**: Plans follow layered architecture (routers → services → repositories → DB)
- **Structured Tracking**: One progress file per phase following AGENTS.md policy

### Token Discipline (Mandatory for Orchestrators)

**Opus must NOT read source documents that subagents will also read.** Provide file paths in delegation prompts instead.

| What to Delegate | Agent | Prompt Size Target |
|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| OQ assessment | haiku (general) | 10-15 lines |
| PRD creation | prd-writer (sonnet) | 30-50 lines |
| Implementation plan | implementation-planner (sonnet) | 40-60 lines |
| Progress files | python-backend-engineer (sonnet) | 20-30 lines |

**What Opus reads directly**: Tracker entries (~5 lines), meta-plan rows (~5 lines), frontmatter for edits (~15 lines). Nothing else.

**Anti-patterns with measured cost**: See `docs/project_plans/AGENTS.md` for the full anti-pattern table with token costs. Key rule: reading a SPIKE as Opus to inform a prd-writer prompt costs ~7K tokens; delegating OQ assessment to haiku costs ~1.2K (6x cheaper).

### Agent Consumption Rule

**Agents invoked for implementation, review, or execution MUST NOT load `docs/project_plans/human-briefs/` files unless the task prompt explicitly names the brief.**

- The `audience: [humans]` frontmatter field is the machine-readable skip signal.
- Briefs contain orchestrator-level rationale (estimation narrative, wave strategy, open-question inventory). This content is irrelevant to executing subagents and burns context budget without improving output quality.
- **Exception**: An agent may be explicitly asked to populate an initial brief skeleton or append a note to the Running Log. In both cases, the task prompt must name the brief file explicitly.
- Spec reference: `.Codex/specs/artifact-structures/human-brief-spec.md` §5.

### When to Use This Skill

- Creating PRDs for new features or enhancements
- Generating detailed implementation plans from PRDs
- Breaking down long planning documents (>800 lines) into manageable files
- Setting up progress tracking for multi-phase work
- Optimizing existing plans for better AI agent consumption
- **Generating Planning Review Boards** to visualize all planning artifacts for a feature

## Quick Start

### Create PRD from Feature Request

```bash
# User provides feature description
User: "Create a PRD for advanced filtering on the prompts page"

# Skill generates PRD at:
# docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/advanced-filtering-v1.md
```

### Create Implementation Plan from PRD

```bash
# Provide PRD path
User: "Create implementation plan for docs/project_plans/PRDs/harden-polish/advanced-filtering-v1.md"

# Skill generates:
# - Main plan: docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/advanced-filtering-v1.md
# - Phase files (if needed): docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/advanced-filtering-v1/phase-[N]-[name].md
```

### Generate Planning Review Board

```bash
# Auto-discover all planning docs for a feature and generate interactive HTML board
python scripts/generate-planning-board.py \
  --feature-slug enterprise-tier-comparison-scopes \
  --wireframe-dir docs/dev/designs/wireframes/enterprise-unified-sync \
  --output planning-review-board.html \
  --open

# Or from a specific implementation plan path
python scripts/generate-planning-board.py \
  --plan docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/some-feature-v1.md

# Preview what would be discovered without generating
python scripts/generate-planning-board.py --feature-slug xyz --dry-run
```

**Reference**: `.Codex/skills/planning/references/planning-review-board.md`

### Optimize Existing Plan

```bash
# Provide existing plan path
User: "Optimize docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/sidebar-polish-v1.md"

# Skill:
# 1. Analyzes plan length (e.g., 1200 lines)
# 2. Breaks into phase-specific files (~400 lines each)
# 3. Updates parent plan with links to phase files
```

### Create Progress Tracking

```bash
# Provide PRD or Implementation Plan
User: "Create progress tracking for data-layer-fixes PRD"

# Skill generates:
# .Codex/progress/[feature-name]/all-phases-progress.md
# With task breakdown, subagent assignments, completion tracking
```

### Track Plan Status Lifecycle

```bash
# Mark PRD approved
python .Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/manage-plan-status.py \
  --file docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/feature-name-v1.md \
  --status approved

# Mark implementation in progress
python .Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/manage-plan-status.py \
  --file docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/feature-name-v1.md \
  --status in-progress

# Mark implementation completed
python .Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/manage-plan-status.py \
  --file docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/feature-name-v1.md \
  --status completed
```

Status values: `draft` → `approved` → `in-progress` → `completed`

**Reference**: See `.Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/plan-status-management.md` for full status management guide.

## Tier Matrix (Routing Decision Tree)

Before authoring any planning artifact, determine the feature's tier. Tier drives artifact type, execution model, reviewer requirement, and model routing. Use the table below.

| Tier | Size | Planning artifact | Execution model | Reviewer | Model routing |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| **0** | 1–3 pts, single file | none | `/dev:quick-feature` | optional | sonnet executor |
| **1** | 3–8 pts | **Feature Contract** (~200–400 lines) | one autonomous sprint per contract | **mandatory** `task-completion-validator` | sonnet executor + sonnet contract writer + Opus design block |
| **2** | 8–13 pts | PRD + Implementation Plan | phase-by-phase orchestration | mandatory `task-completion-validator` per phase; `karen` at feature end | sonnet executor + sonnet `implementation-planner` + Opus decisions block |
| **3** | 13+ pts | SPIKE + PRD + Implementation Plan | phase-by-phase orchestration | mandatory `karen` per phase milestone + end of feature | sonnet executor + sonnet `implementation-planner` + Opus decisions block |

**How to apply**:

1. Estimate the feature in story points before creating any artifact.
2. Select the tier from the table above.
3. Follow the matching workflow below (Tier 0 → `/dev:quick-feature`; Tier 1 → "Workflow: Tier 1 Feature Contract"; Tier 2/3 → "Workflow 2: Create Implementation Plan from PRD").
4. If scope expands during planning and crosses a tier boundary upward, promote — don't stretch. See promotion rule in the Tier 1 workflow.

## CCDash Frontmatter Requirements

Use CCDash-aligned frontmatter for all planning artifacts.

- Reference: `.Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/schemas/field-reference.md`
- Baseline fields for all planning docs: `schema_version`, `doc_type`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `feature_slug`
- Linkage fields: `prd_ref`, `plan_ref`, `related_documents`
- Lifecycle fields to update after implementation: `commit_refs`, `pr_refs`, `files_affected`
- Set on merge to destination branch: `merge_commit` (post-squash SHA on `main`/destination), `merge_branch` — required for direct squash-merges (no PR) so the orphaned branch SHAs remain resolvable

### Canonical Paths Table

All planning documents follow a canonical location pattern by doc type, enabling discovery and cross-referencing.

| doc_type | Purpose | Canonical Location | Feeds / Downstream |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `design_spec` | Pre-PRD ideation and design, varying maturity | `docs/project_plans/design-specs/[name].md` | `prd` |
| `prd` | Formal product requirements | `docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[name]-v1.md` | `implementation_plan` |
| `implementation_plan` | Phased technical breakdown | `docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/[name]-v1.md` | `phase_plan`, `progress` |
| `phase_plan` | Single phase (if parent plan >800 lines) | `docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/[name]-v1/phase-[N]-[title].md` | `progress` |
| `progress` | Phase task tracking and orchestration | `.Codex/progress/[feature-slug]/phase-[N]-progress.md` | — |
| `spike` | Formal research investigation with charter | `docs/project_plans/SPIKEs/[name]-charter.md` or `docs/project_plans/SPIKEs/[name].md` | `design_spec`, `prd`, ADR |
| `report` | Investigation, audit, finding, post-mortem | `docs/project_plans/reports/[category]/[name].md` or `.Codex/findings/[name].md` | `design_spec`, `prd` |
| `meta_plan` | Workflow, process, or tooling change (not product) | `.Codex/plans/[name].md` | — |
| `human_brief` | Human-orchestrator lens: estimation rationale, wave strategy, OQ ledger, success behaviors | `docs/project_plans/human-briefs/[feature-slug].md` | — (audience: humans; agents skip) |

**Categories** (PRD and implementation_plan subdirs): `features`, `enhancements`, `refactors`, `harden-polish`, `infrastructure`

**Report categories** (subdirs under `docs/project_plans/reports/`): `findings`, `investigations`, `audits`, `post-mortems`, `refactor-reports`

### Cross-Reference Policy

**Prefer envelope fields over ad-hoc fields** for linking planning documents. This enables consistent discovery and prevents scattered linkage patterns.

**Canonical linkage fields** (prefer these):
- `prd_ref`: Path to the PRD this design_spec or report is linked to
- `plan_ref`: Path to the implementation plan this phase_plan or progress is linked to
- `spike_ref`: Path to the spike this design_spec or PRD references
- `related_documents`: Array of paths to related docs (cross-references, background, context)

**Legacy fields to migrate** (phase out over time):
- `related_prds`: OLD; use `prd_ref` or `related_documents` instead
- Scattered ad-hoc fields in existing docs that don't follow envelope schema

**Migration strategy**: When updating a design_spec or report with `related_prds`, refactor to use `prd_ref` (if single primary PRD) or move items into `related_documents` (if multiple cross-references).

**Example**:
```yaml
# OLD (avoid):
related_prds:
  - docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/xyz-v1.md

# NEW (correct):
prd_ref: docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/xyz-v1.md

# Multiple related docs:
related_documents:
  - docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/xyz-v1.md
  - docs/dev/architecture/adr-123.md
  - .Codex/context/some-pattern.md
```

### Field Checklist by Doc Type

- `prd`
  - Required now: `schema_version`, `doc_type: prd`, `title`, `status`, `created`
  - Populate early: `feature_slug`, `priority`, `risk_level`, `owner`, `contributors`
  - Keep `prd_ref: null`; set `plan_ref` after implementation plan exists
  - Optional: `changelog_required: true` — set when the feature introduces user-facing changes that must appear in CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` before release. Omit (default: unset, treated as false) for purely internal or infrastructure-only changes. When set, Phase 7 Documentation Finalization **must** include a CHANGELOG entry. See `.Codex/specs/changelog-spec.md` for categorization rules.

- `implementation_plan`
  - Required now: `schema_version`, `doc_type: implementation_plan`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `prd_ref`
  - Populate early: `scope`, `effort_estimate`, `feature_slug`, `priority`, `risk_level`
  - Set `plan_ref: null` for root implementation plan
  - If plan includes deferred items or research-needed items: populate `deferred_items_spec_refs` as design specs are authored in the final phase; populate `findings_doc_ref` if a findings doc is created lazily during execution
  - Optional: `changelog_required: true` — inherit from the parent PRD or set independently when the implementation scope confirms user-facing changes. When set, Phase 7 Documentation Finalization **must** include a CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` entry. Default: unset (false). See `.Codex/specs/changelog-spec.md`.

- `phase_plan`
  - Required now: `schema_version`, `doc_type: phase_plan`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `phase`, `phase_title`
  - Populate early: `prd_ref`, `plan_ref`, `entry_criteria`, `exit_criteria`
  - Keep `feature_slug` aligned with parent PRD/plan

- `spike`
  - Required now: `schema_version`, `doc_type: spike`, `title`, `status`, `created`
  - Populate early: `feature_slug`, `research_questions`, `complexity`, `estimated_research_time`
  - Set `prd_ref`/`plan_ref` when spike is linked to planned work

- `human_brief`
  - Required always: `schema_name: ccdash_document`, `schema_version: 2`, `doc_type: human_brief`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `audience: [humans]`, `feature_slug`, `category: human-briefs`
  - Required when linked docs exist: `prd_ref`, `plan_ref`
  - Populate early: `owner`, `priority`, `confidence`, `feature_family`, `feature_version`
  - Reserve but leave null: `intent_ref`, `epic_ref` (forward-compat for INTENT.md system)
  - Do NOT set `blocked` or `superseded` status — use only `draft`, `in-progress`, `completed`
  - Full schema: `.Codex/specs/artifact-structures/human-brief-spec.md` §2

## Frontmatter Lifecycle

Planning artifacts follow a structured lifecycle as they move through the SDLC. Frontmatter fields populate progressively at each phase.

### Field Population Timeline

| Field | Draft | Approved | In-Progress | Completed |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `title` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `description` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `status` | draft | approved | in-progress | completed |
| `created` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `updated` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `prd_ref` | null | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `plan_ref` | null | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `contributors` | [author] | [author] | [author + team] | [author + team] |
| `milestone` | null | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `commit_refs` | [] | [] | [refs...] | [refs...] |
| `pr_refs` | [] | [] | [refs...] | [refs...] |
| `merge_commit` | null | null | null | `<sha>` |
| `merge_branch` | null | null | null | `main` (or destination) |
| `files_affected` | [] | [] | [files...] | [files...] |

**Lifecycle Phases**:

- **Draft**: Initial creation with title, description, author. Status defaults to `draft`.
- **Approved**: PRD/plan review complete. Set status to `approved` and populate cross-references (`prd_ref` / `plan_ref`).
- **In-Progress**: Execution begins. Add implementation team to `contributors`, set `milestone` target, track `commit_refs` as work commits.
- **Completed**: All tasks done. Finalize `commit_refs`, `pr_refs`, `files_affected` list, and — once merged to the destination branch — set `merge_commit` + `merge_branch` to the canonical landing SHA. For direct squash-merges with no PR, `merge_commit` is the only in-repo way to resolve where the feature actually landed (branch SHAs become orphans).

**Status Management**:

Use `manage-plan-status.py` to advance status lifecycle:

```bash
python .Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/manage-plan-status.py \
  --file docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/feature-name-v1.md \
  --status approved
```

Use `update-field.py` to append to list fields (`contributors`, `commit_refs`, `pr_refs`, `files_affected`):

```bash
python .Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/update-field.py \
  -f docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/feature-name-v1.md \
  --append "pr_refs=#123"
```

After merging the feature branch to `main` (or another destination), set the scalar `merge_commit` and `merge_branch` fields so the canonical landing SHA is recorded in-repo (does not depend on GitHub API for direct squash-merges):

```bash
python .Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/update-field.py \
  -f docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/feature-name-v1.md \
  --set "merge_commit=4e64e630" \
  --set "merge_branch=main"
```

**Full field lifecycle details**: `.Codex/skills/artifact-tracking/schemas/field-reference.md`

## Lifecycle Guidance

Planning artifacts follow a natural progression from ideation through implementation. Use this guide to determine when to create each document type.

**Human Briefs** are opt-in living documents that accompany PRDs and plans for qualifying features (≥8 pts, ≥2 phases, or notable orchestration complexity — see Workflow 5 heuristic). They live at `docs/project_plans/human-briefs/[feature-slug].md` alongside their linked PRD and plan, evolve throughout the feature lifecycle, and are archived in place when the feature ships. Unlike plans, briefs are not versioned — no `-v1` suffix. See `.Codex/specs/artifact-structures/human-brief-spec.md` §4 for the full heuristic.

### Rough Idea → `design_spec`

**When**: You have a raw idea, loose thoughts, or unstructured exploration on a potential feature or change.

**What to do**:
1. Create a new file in `docs/project_plans/design-specs/[name].md`
2. Set `maturity: idea` in frontmatter
3. Add sections: problem statement (optional), open questions, explored alternatives
4. This is your working document for shaping the idea

**Example**:
```yaml
---
schema_version: 2
doc_type: design_spec
maturity: idea
title: "Real-time Sync Architecture"
status: draft
created: 2026-04-08
feature_slug: realtime-sync
---
```

### Gaining Shape → `maturity: shaping` → `maturity: ready`

**When**: The `design_spec` has structure, you've explored trade-offs, and it's crystallizing into a concrete proposal.

**What to do**:
1. Update the design_spec file
2. Change `maturity: shaping` (has structure, exploring)
3. Populate sections: problem_statement, open_questions, explored_alternatives
4. Continue iterating until all open questions are resolved
5. When ready to formalize, bump to `maturity: ready`

**Example**:
```yaml
maturity: shaping         # Has structure, exploring trade-offs
# ... after resolving questions and alternatives:
maturity: ready           # Ready to promote to PRD
```

### Promote → Create `prd`

**When**: The design_spec is at `maturity: ready` and you're ready to formalize as a product requirement.

**What to do**:
1. Create a new PRD at `docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[name]-v1.md`
2. Update the design_spec:
   - Set `maturity: promoted`
   - Add `prd_ref: docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[name]-v1.md`
3. Reference the design_spec in the PRD as context/background
4. Move forward with PRD lifecycle and implementation planning

**Example**:
```yaml
# In design_spec:
maturity: promoted
prd_ref: docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/realtime-sync-v1.md
```

### Workflow/Process/Tooling Change → `meta_plan`

**When**: You need to document a change to how the team works (process), tools used (tooling), or infrastructure changes (NOT a product feature).

**What to do**:
1. Create a new file in `.Codex/plans/[name].md`
2. Set `doc_type: meta_plan` and `scope: [process|tooling|workflow|infrastructure|documentation|other]`
3. Document: what's changing, why, affects_skills, affects_commands, expected outcome
4. This is distinct from product PRDs and tracks workflow improvements

**Example**:
```yaml
---
schema_version: 2
doc_type: meta_plan
title: "Planning Document Cleanup"
scope: process
status: in-progress
affects_skills: [planning, artifact-tracking, plan-status]
---
```

### Investigation/Audit/Finding → `report`

**When**: You discover something worth documenting (bug investigation, performance audit, learning, post-mortem) that informs product or process decisions.

**What to do**:
1. For **raw findings during execution**, create in `.Codex/findings/[name].md` with minimal frontmatter (status: draft, source: agent)
2. When finding proves **load-bearing**, promote to `docs/project_plans/reports/[category]/[slug].md` with full frontmatter
3. Link the report to the PRD or design_spec it informs via `prd_ref` or `related_documents`
4. Report categories: `findings`, `investigations`, `audits`, `post-mortems`, `refactor-reports`

**Example** (raw finding):
```yaml
---
schema_version: 2
doc_type: report
report_category: finding
title: "SQLAlchemy Comparator Cache Poisoning"
status: draft
source: agent
created: 2026-04-08
feature_slug: enterprise-db-layer
---
```

**Example** (promoted finding):
```yaml
---
schema_version: 2
doc_type: report
report_category: finding
title: "SQLAlchemy Comparator Cache Poisoning"
status: accepted
source: agent
created: 2026-04-08
prd_ref: docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/enterprise-database-v1.md
promoted_to: [docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/enterprise-database-v1.md]
outcome: "Implemented manual cache refresh in enterprise repository tests"
---
```

### `design_spec` Maturity States

Use the maturity field to track ideation progress:

| State | Definition | Next Step |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `idea` | Raw ideation, loose thoughts | Explore and structure |
| `shaping` | Has structure, actively exploring | Resolve open questions |
| `ready` | Resolved questions, ready to promote | Create PRD |
| `promoted` | Has prd_ref, formalized to PRD | Use PRD for implementation |
| `shelved` | Not pursuing this idea | Archive if needed |

## Core Workflows

### Workflow: Tier 1 Feature Contract

**Applies to**: Features estimated at 3–8 story points with a clear, bounded scope and enumerable acceptance criteria. Single-feature scope; does not require multi-phase orchestration.

**Artifact**: `docs/project_plans/feature_contracts/[category]/[feature-slug].md`

**Template**: `.Codex/skills/planning/templates/feature-contract-template.md`

**Why not a PRD + Plan?**: A 5-pt feature costs ~150–200K tokens with the heavyweight flow. The Feature Contract delivers the same outcome at ~60–80K tokens through a single autonomous sprint rather than N batch-orchestration rounds.

**Steps**:

1. **Opus drafts the contract design block** (~15K tokens):
   - Fill in `Goal`, `User/Actor`, `Job To Be Done`, `Scope`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Risk Areas`, and `Architecture Constraints` using the template.
   - Set `tier: 1` and `estimated_points: N` in frontmatter.
   - Keep the design block to ~50–80 lines — Opus provides the judgment scaffold; sonnet expands the rest.

2. **Delegate contract expansion to sonnet contract writer** (prd-writer or feature-planner agent):
   - Provide the Opus design block (file path) and the feature-contract-template.md (file path).
   - The agent fills in `UX/Behavior Requirements`, `Data Requirements`, `API/Integration Requirements`, and `Implementation Notes`.
   - Target: complete contract of 200–400 lines.

3. **Opus sanity review** (~3K tokens):
   - Verify acceptance criteria are testable and unambiguous.
   - Verify scope boundary is clear enough for an autonomous sprint.
   - Verify risk areas are identified.
   - Approve or send back for revision.

4. **Hand off to autonomous sprint**:
   - Delegate the full contract to `feature-sprint-executor` (sonnet, `acceptEdits`) using Mode C: Autonomous Feature Sprint.
   - Provide contract file path; the executor reads it directly.
   - The executor implements the full feature: explores, codes, adds tests, validates, and produces a Completion Report.

5. **Mandatory reviewer pass**:
   - `task-completion-validator` reviews: contract acceptance criteria, validation results, and Completion Report.
   - Reviewer must pass before Opus commits.
   - Reviewer output format: see `.Codex/skills/dev-execution/validation/completion-criteria.md`.

6. **Opus commits** if review passes.

**Promotion rule** (scope growth): If during contract drafting (steps 1–2) the estimated points cross 8, **stop and promote to Tier 2**. Author a PRD that references the draft contract via `related_documents` and create an Implementation Plan using Workflow 2. Do not retrofit a Tier 1 contract for genuinely complex work. Set `prd_ref` in the contract frontmatter pointing to the new PRD.

**Total cost target**: ~60–80K tokens, 3–4 prompt round-trips (contract draft → expansion → sprint → review).

### Workflow 1: Create PRD from Feature Request

**Input**: Feature description or request from user

**Process**:

1. **Analyze Request**
   - Extract feature name, scope, goals
   - Identify related systems and components
   - Determine priority and complexity

2. **Structure PRD**
   - Use template: `./templates/prd-template.md`
   - Follow MP architecture patterns (see `./references/mp-architecture.md`)
   - Include frontmatter with proper metadata
   - Organize into standard PRD sections

3. **Add Implementation Context**
   - Break into phased approach
   - Identify architectural layers involved
   - Note dependencies and risks
   - Define success criteria and acceptance tests

4. **Determine Location**
   - Category: `docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/`
   - Categories: `harden-polish`, `features`, `enhancements`, `refactors`
   - Naming: `[feature-name]-v1.md` (kebab-case)

5. **Generate File**
   - Write PRD to determined location
   - Include YAML frontmatter with metadata
   - Link to related docs (ADRs, guides, etc.)
   - Add to project tracking if needed

**Output**:
- PRD file at: `docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md`
- Follows template structure
- Ready for implementation planning

**Example**:

```markdown
Input: "Add real-time collaboration features to prompt editing"

Output Location: docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/realtime-collaboration-v1.md

Sections:
1. Executive Summary - Real-time collaborative editing
2. Context & Background - Current single-user editing limitations
3. Problem Statement - Users can't collaborate on prompts
4. Goals & Success Metrics - Multiple concurrent editors, conflict resolution
5. Requirements - WebSocket connections, operational transforms, presence indicators
6. Implementation Phases - Phase 1: Backend infrastructure, Phase 2: Frontend integration
... (full PRD structure)
```

### Workflow 2: Create Implementation Plan from PRD

**Input**: Path to existing PRD or newly created PRD

**Process**:

1. **Analyze PRD**
   - Read full PRD content
   - Extract key requirements
   - Identify architectural layers needed
   - Determine phase breakdown strategy

2. **Plan Phase Structure**
   - Follow MP layered architecture: routers → services → repositories → DB
   - Group related tasks into phases
   - Common phases: Database → Repository → Service → API → UI → Testing → Docs → Deployment
   - Consider parallel work opportunities
   - Identify critical path
   - **Populate the Phase Summary table** in Implementation Strategy (after Critical Path) with every phase, point estimate, target subagents, and model designation. This table is mandatory — it is the canonical orchestration index executors use to plan delegation. Keep it synced with detailed phase breakdowns. Use Codex models by default (`sonnet` / `haiku`); note external models (e.g., `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `nano-banana-pro`, `gpt-5.6-terra`) per `references/multi-model-guidance.md`.

2.5 **Opus Decisions Block (Tier 2/3 mandatory)** — author before delegating to `implementation-planner`:
   - Opus authors a ~200-line decisions block using `./templates/decisions-block-template.md`.
   - Decisions block covers: phase boundaries, agent routing per phase, risk hotspots (severity + mitigation), estimation anchors with comparable past features, dependency map (critical path + parallelizable slices), and model routing per phase per agent.
   - This is Opus-direct (not delegated) — it is the architectural judgment scaffold that earns Opus its premium on Tier 2/3 features.
   - Target ~200 lines; do not expand into full template prose — that is `implementation-planner`'s job.
   - Write the decisions block to `.Codex/worknotes/[feature-slug]/decisions-block.md` (temporary working file).

   Then delegate expansion to `implementation-planner` (sonnet):
   - Provide: decisions block path + PRD path + implementation-plan-template.md path.
   - The agent expands the decisions block into the full plan template: detailed phase descriptions, task breakdowns, batch definitions, task tables, success criteria, and model/effort columns.
   - `implementation-planner` runs on **sonnet** (not haiku) — plans drive 200K+ tokens of downstream execution; this is the highest-leverage model routing call in the planning workflow.

   Opus sanity review post-expansion (~3K tokens):
   - Verify phase boundaries match decisions block.
   - Verify agent routing is correctly propagated to task table.
   - Verify no critical risks were dropped.
   - Approve or send back for targeted revision.

   **Source**: `.Codex/plans/tiered-workflow-overhaul.md` §4.2

3. **Generate Task Breakdown**
   - Use template: `./templates/implementation-plan-template.md`
   - Create tasks for each phase
   - Format: Task tables with ID, Name, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimate
   - Include quality gates for each phase

3.5 **Run Estimation Sanity Check (mandatory) — write output to Human Brief, not the plan**
   - Use reference: `./references/estimation-heuristics.md`
   - Determine if a Human Brief applies (see §4 creation heuristic in `.Codex/specs/artifact-structures/human-brief-spec.md`).
   - If brief applies: scaffold `docs/project_plans/human-briefs/[feature-slug].md` using `./templates/human-brief-template.md`, then populate **§2 Estimation Sanity Check** in the brief with the H1–H6 output.
   - If brief does not apply (feature too small): populate the H1–H6 check in a comment or scratchpad for your own reference; do not add the full block to the plan.
   - Apply heuristics H1–H6 **bottom-up**:
     - H1: noun-counting (≥2 pts per new CRUD-with-RBAC table)
     - H2: dual-implementation multiplier (~1.8× repo subtotal when local+enterprise)
     - H3: algorithmic service flag (≥3 pts for any service whose description includes dependency / resolution / graph / conflict / cycle / solver / inference / ranking / scheduling / merge / diff / transform; SPIKE first if test scenarios cannot be enumerated)
     - H4: bundle-vs-sum (per-area estimates summed = floor for plan total when ≥3 capability areas)
     - H5: anchor reference (cite a comparable completed feature, justify any delta >30%)
     - H6: hidden plumbing budget (~15–20% line item for DTOs / DI / OpenAPI / RLS / inventory updates / CHANGELOG)
   - If bottom-up total disagrees with top-down intuition, **trust bottom-up** or write justification.
   - Set `**Human Brief**` pointer line near the top of the plan (the template provides the field).

4. **Assign Subagents**
   - Use reference: `./references/subagent-assignments.md`
   - Assign based on task type:
     - Database: `data-layer-expert`
     - Backend API: `python-backend-engineer`, `backend-architect`
     - Frontend: `ui-engineer-enhanced`, `frontend-developer`
     - UI Components: `ui-designer`, `ui-engineer`
     - Testing: appropriate testing agents
     - Docs: `documentation-writer`, `documentation-complex`
   - Add to each task: "Assigned Subagent(s): agent-1, agent-2"

5. **Model Assignment**
   - Evaluate each task for the appropriate model:
     - Default: `sonnet` for implementation, `haiku` for docs/exploration
     - Route image generation → `nano-banana-pro`
     - Route UI wireframing/design → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`
     - Route web research → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`
     - Route debug escalation → `gpt-5.6-terra`
   - Assign effort levels per model (reference `[models.effort_levels]` in `.Codex/config/multi-model.toml`)
   - Group external model tasks as pre-work (batch_0) when possible
   - Add to each task: "Model: [model]; Effort: [level]"
   - Reference: See `./references/multi-model-guidance.md` for detailed routing logic

6. **UI Extraction Evaluation** (UI-Heavy Phases Only)
   - For phases with React/UI component work, evaluate against extraction criteria
   - Flag reusable components with `[pkg]` marker in task descriptions
   - Evaluate: multiple projects reuse (2+), generic API design, stability window (2+ weeks), no app-specific dependencies
   - Document extraction candidates for potential `@meaty/ui` packaging
   - Reference: `./references/ui-extraction-guidance.md` for criteria details
   - Full spec: `.Codex/specs/ui-package-extraction-spec.md`

7.5 **Deferred Items & Findings Planning**
   - Scan the PRD for deferred/backlog/research-needed items, open questions with `OQ-*` markers, or spike-needed investigations
   - List them in a "Deferred Items" triage table in the plan's `## Deferred Items & In-Flight Findings Policy` section
   - Add a corresponding design-spec authoring task row (DOC-006) for each item — or document "N/A — no deferred items" if none exist
   - Initialize `deferred_items_spec_refs: []` and `findings_doc_ref: null` in plan frontmatter
   - Reference: `./references/deferred-items-and-findings.md`

7. **Documentation Evaluation**
   - Assess which docs require updates based on feature scope:
     - **CHANGELOG**: Include if user-facing changes (new features, breaking changes, deprecations). When `changelog_required: true` is set in frontmatter, a CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` entry is **mandatory** in the Documentation Finalization phase before release. Categorization rules: `.Codex/specs/changelog-spec.md`.
     - **README**: Include if features, CLI commands, screenshots, or version change
     - **User/dev docs**: Include if behavior changes requiring user/developer knowledge
     - **Context files**: Include if changes affect agent behavior or architectural patterns
     - **Project-level custom skills**: Include if changes affect domain of a custom skill (new CLI commands, capability changes, workflow shifts); check `.Codex/specs/skills-index.md` for domain ownership
   - Create doc tasks for the Documentation Finalization phase:
     - CHANGELOG → `changelog-generator` agent with `changelog-generator` skill
     - README/docs → `documentation-writer` agent with `managing-readmes` skill
     - Context files → `documentation-writer` agent (progressive disclosure: AGENTS.md pointers only, detail in key-context)
     - Project-level skills → `ai-artifacts-engineer` (SPEC.md + SKILL.md) and `documentation-writer` (workflows)
   - Keep docs minimal/usage-focused, not verbose
   - Reference: `./references/doc-finalization-guidance.md` for detailed heuristics
   - Add "Model: haiku; Effort: low" to doc tasks (or "Model: sonnet; Effort: medium" for skill SPEC updates)

8. **Optimize for Token Efficiency**
   - If total plan >800 lines: break into phase-specific files
   - Pattern: `[feature-name]-v1/phase-[N]-[name].md`
   - Parent plan links to phase files
   - Each phase file <800 lines
   - See `./references/optimization-patterns.md`

9. **Generate Files**
   - Main plan: `docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md`
   - Phase files (if needed): `docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/[feature-name]-v1/phase-[N]-[name].md`
   - Link phase files from parent plan

**Output**:
- Implementation Plan at determined location
- Phase breakdown with subagent assignments
- Linked phase files if plan >800 lines
- Quality gates and success criteria per phase

**Example**:

```markdown
Input PRD: docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/realtime-collaboration-v1.md

Output:
Main Plan: docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/realtime-collaboration-v1.md

Phase Breakdown:
- Phase 1: Database Layer (websocket_sessions, edit_locks tables) - data-layer-expert
- Phase 2: Repository Layer (session management, lock management) - python-backend-engineer
- Phase 3: Service Layer (operational transforms, conflict resolution) - backend-architect
- Phase 4: API Layer (WebSocket endpoints, presence API) - python-backend-engineer
- Phase 5: UI Layer (collaborative editor, presence indicators) - ui-engineer-enhanced, frontend-developer
- Phase 6: Testing (unit, integration, E2E conflict scenarios) - testing agents
- Phase 7: Documentation (API docs, user guides) - documentation-writer
- Phase 8: Deployment (feature flags, monitoring) - DevOps

Phase Files (if plan >800 lines):
- realtime-collaboration-v1/phase-1-database.md
- realtime-collaboration-v1/phase-2-repository.md
- realtime-collaboration-v1/phase-3-5-backend.md (grouped related phases)
- realtime-collaboration-v1/phase-6-8-validation.md (grouped related phases)
```

### Workflow 3: Optimize Existing Plans

**Input**: Path to existing PRD or Implementation Plan that's >800 lines

**Process**:

1. **Analyze Plan**
   - Read full plan
   - Count total lines
   - Identify natural break points (phases, sections)
   - Determine optimal split strategy

2. **Determine Breakout Strategy**
   - Primary: Break by phase (most common)
   - Secondary: Break by domain (backend vs frontend)
   - Tertiary: Break by task type (implementation vs testing)
   - Goal: Each file <800 lines, logically cohesive

3. **Create Breakout Files**
   - Pattern: `[plan-name]/phase-[N]-[name].md`
   - Alternative: `[plan-name]/[domain]-tasks.md`
   - Each file includes:
     - Phase/section overview
     - Relevant tasks with subagent assignments
     - Quality gates for that section
     - Links back to parent plan

4. **Update Parent Plan**
   - Add table of contents linking to breakout files
   - Keep executive summary and overview in parent
   - Replace detailed sections with links:
     ```markdown
     ## Phase 2: Repository Layer
     See [Phase 2 Implementation Details](./[plan-name]/phase-2-repository.md)
     ```
   - Maintain quality gates summary in parent

5. **Validate Optimization**
   - Each file <800 lines ✓
   - All content preserved ✓
   - Links work correctly ✓
   - Logical grouping maintained ✓
   - Progressive disclosure achieved ✓

**Output**:
- Optimized parent plan (summary + links)
- Breakout files for detailed content
- Improved token efficiency (95%+ reduction in single-load context)

**Example**:

```markdown
Input: docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/sidebar-polish-v1.md (1200 lines)

Analysis:
- 8 phases, ~150 lines each
- Can group related phases: 1-3 (backend), 4-5 (frontend), 6-8 (validation)

Output:
Parent: sidebar-polish-v1.md (200 lines - summary + links)
Phase Files:
- sidebar-polish-v1/phase-1-3-backend.md (450 lines)
- sidebar-polish-v1/phase-4-5-frontend.md (400 lines)
- sidebar-polish-v1/phase-6-8-validation.md (350 lines)

Token Efficiency:
- Before: Load 1200 lines for any query
- After: Load 200-line summary, then specific phase (450 max) = 67% reduction
```

### Workflow 4: Create Progress Tracking

**Input**: PRD or Implementation Plan

**Process**:

Utilize artifact-tracking skill to create progress tracking and context artifacts per the skill instructions.

You should NOT create these files from this skill, as there are specific optimizations and structures required by the artifact-tracking skill.

### Workflow 5: Create Human Brief for Feature

**Input**: PRD path + Implementation Plan path (both required when they exist)

**Spec reference**: `.Codex/specs/artifact-structures/human-brief-spec.md`

**Process**:

1. **Check creation heuristic (§4 of spec)** — create a brief when any of these are true:
   - Feature is ≥8 story points estimated
   - Implementation plan has ≥2 phases
   - Estimation Sanity Check has non-trivial anchor comparison
   - ≥2 deferred items with non-trivial rationale
   - Feature spans ≥2 capability areas
   - Notable orchestration complexity (wave coordination, cross-team dependencies)
   Skip when: quick feature (<5 pts, single phase), trivial refactor, single-file fix.

2. **Scaffold the brief** at `docs/project_plans/human-briefs/[feature-slug].md`
   - Use template: `./templates/human-brief-template.md`
   - No `-v1` suffix — briefs are living documents, not versioned deliverables
   - Set `prd_ref`, `plan_ref`, `feature_slug`, `owner`, `status: draft`

3. **Populate on creation**:
   - **§1 Context Pointers**: one-line links to PRD, plan, design specs, SPIKEs
   - **§2 Estimation Sanity Check**: migrate H1–H6 output from planning step 3.5
   - **§4 Open Questions Ledger**: harvest `OQ-*` markers from PRD and plan
   - **§8 Expected Success Behaviors**: extract human-verifiable outcomes from PRD acceptance criteria

4. **Populate as information becomes available**:
   - §3 Wave & Orchestration Notes — after phase structure is finalized
   - §5 Deferred Items Rationale — after triage table in plan is populated
   - §6 Risk Narrative — after risk section in plan is written
   - §7 What to Watch For — before or during execution
   - §9 Running Log — append-only during execution

5. **Set brief as in-progress** when execution begins; **completed** when feature ships.

**Output**: `docs/project_plans/human-briefs/[feature-slug].md`

**Agents must not load this file during execution** (see Agent Consumption Rule below and spec §5).

## Token Discipline (Planning Workflows)

These rules apply to all planning workflows in this skill. They codify the existing project-wide budget discipline for the planning context specifically.

**Reference**: `.Codex/rules/context-budget.md` (global rules); `.Codex/plans/tiered-workflow-overhaul.md` §4.9

### The Feature Contract (or Decisions Block) Is the Delta

The Feature Contract (Tier 1) and the Opus Decisions Block (Tier 2/3) carry only the *new decisions* for this feature. All stable architectural context lives in durable docs and must not be restated in contracts or plans:

- **Product intent**: `intents/intent.md` (when available)
- **Current system state**: `docs/current-state.md` (when available)
- **Architecture patterns**: `docs/dev/architecture/*` — link to these, do not copy from them
- **Agent operating rules**: `AGENTS.md`

Do not restate what is already in durable docs. Provide a path reference instead.

### Prompt and Artifact Sizing

| What | Target |
|------|--------|
| Task prompts to subagents | < 500 words |
| Opus decisions block | ~200 lines |
| Tier 1 Feature Contract | 200–400 lines |
| PRD (per doc) | ≤ 800 lines; split into phase files if exceeded |
| Context passed to subagents | File paths, not file contents |

### Progressive Disclosure for Planners

When authoring contracts or decisions blocks, load context in this order — stop when you have enough:

1. **Contract or Decisions Block itself** — the immediate planning surface.
2. **Relevant files** — only files directly touched by this feature.
3. **Deep context docs** (`key-context/`, architecture docs) — only when blocked by an unresolved design question.
4. **Historical plans** — only to confirm comparable estimates; verify behavior from runtime truth (`openapi.json`, `symbols-*.json`), not from old plans.

### Anti-Patterns (with token cost)

| Anti-pattern | Cost | Correct approach |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| Opus reads a full PRD before delegating to prd-writer | ~7K tokens | Delegate comprehension; provide file paths only |
| Restating AGENTS.md patterns in the delegation prompt | ~5K tokens | Reference AGENTS.md by path |
| Calling `TaskOutput()` for plan-writing agents | ~7.5K tokens | Check file on disk with Glob + Read |
| Exploring files Opus will hand to a subagent | ~3–10K tokens | Let the subagent explore its own context |

## Reviewer Gates (Summary Pointer)

Reviewer-agent passes are **mandatory at tier-appropriate checkpoints**. Planning artifacts are not complete until the matching reviewer has signed off.

| Tier | Gate | Reviewer |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | End of autonomous sprint | `task-completion-validator` |
| 2 | End of each phase | `task-completion-validator` |
| 2 | End of feature | `karen` |
| 3 | End of each phase | `task-completion-validator` |
| 3 | Mid-feature milestones + end of feature | `karen` |

A phase or sprint is not "complete" until the reviewer passes it. Do not commit before the gate clears.

**Full gate definitions and reviewer output format**: `.Codex/skills/dev-execution/validation/completion-criteria.md`

## References

### estimation-heuristics.md

**Location**: `./references/estimation-heuristics.md`
**Purpose**: Bottom-up sizing rules to prevent under-estimation. Codifies six heuristics — noun-counting (H1), dual-implementation multiplier (H2), algorithmic service flag (H3), bundle-vs-sum check (H4), anchor reference comparison (H5), hidden plumbing budget (H6) — and the mandatory "Estimation Sanity Check" template every implementation plan must populate.
**Used By**: Implementation plan authoring (mandatory sanity check), `plan-review` skill (post-mortem heuristic tuning).
**When to load**: Always, when creating or reviewing an implementation plan estimate.

### subagent-assignments.md

**Location**: `./references/subagent-assignments.md`
**Purpose**: Mapping of task types to appropriate subagents
**Used By**: Implementation planning, progress tracking creation

### file-structure.md

**Location**: `./references/file-structure.md`
**Purpose**: Directory structure conventions for plans and progress
**Naming Conventions**:
- PRDs: `[feature-name]-v1.md` (kebab-case)
- Implementation Plans: `[feature-name]-v1.md`
- Phase Files: `phase-[N]-[name].md` or `phase-[N]-[M]-[name].md` (grouped)
**Used By**: File creation, optimization

### optimization-patterns.md

**Location**: `./references/optimization-patterns.md`

**Purpose**: Patterns for breaking up long files into token-efficient chunks

**Content**:

**Pattern 1: Break by Phase** (Most Common)
- Split implementation plan by phase (1-3, 4-5, 6-8)
- Each phase file <800 lines
- Parent links to phase files
- Progressive disclosure: Load summary, then specific phase

**Pattern 2: Break by Domain**
- Backend phases (Database, Repository, Service, API)
- Frontend phases (UI, Components, State)
- Validation phases (Testing, Docs, Deployment)

**Pattern 3: Break by Task Type**
- Implementation tasks
- Testing tasks
- Documentation tasks
- Deployment tasks

**Pattern 4: Keep Together**
- Always keep in parent plan:
  - Executive summary
  - Phase overview table
  - Risk mitigation summary
  - Success metrics overview
- Move to phase files:
  - Detailed task breakdowns
  - Specific acceptance criteria
  - Technical implementation notes

**Token Efficiency Gains**:
- Before: Load entire 1200-line plan
- After: Load 200-line summary + 400-line phase = 50% reduction
- For targeted queries: Load only relevant phase = 67%+ reduction

**Used By**: Plan optimization workflow

## Plan Generator Rules (Mandatory)

Apply these rules whenever generating or reviewing an implementation plan or any phase that contains ACs. These rules are non-negotiable; they catch the class of integration/verification gaps documented in the motivating incident (`ccdash-planning-reskin-v2-interaction-performance-addendum`).

- **R-P1** — *No AC may contain the words "across", "everywhere", "throughout", "all X", or "visible" without an explicit `target_surfaces:` list.* If the AC uses any of these terms without enumerating concrete component paths, the plan generator must expand the AC inline.
- **R-P2** — *Every new backend field X introduced in a phase introduces an implicit AC "FE handles missing X".* If this AC is not already present, the generator writes it automatically. Resilience is a contract state, not a reviewer's courtesy.
- **R-P3** — *Every phase with ≥2 owner specialties (e.g., FE + BE) and overlapping `files_affected` (intersection ≥1 file) must declare an `integration_owner` field and at least one seam task.* A seam task is a task whose sole purpose is to verify the cross-owner propagation contract.
- **R-P4** — *UI-touching phases (any `*.tsx` file in `files_affected`) must include a "runtime smoke" task in the verification phase.* The smoke task must reference every `target_surfaces` entry from that phase.

**AC schema for structured ACs** (use this format whenever an AC covers multi-surface propagation or has resilience requirements):

```markdown
#### AC [ID]: [Short description]
- target_surfaces:
    # Use path strings (see §8 Q1 note in references/ac-schema.md).
    - components/Planning/PlanningSummaryPanel.tsx
    - components/Planning/PlanningGraphPanel.tsx
- propagation_contract: [how the value flows from producer to each surface]
- resilience: [how each surface behaves when the field is absent/null]
- visual_evidence_required: [screenshot spec, e.g. "desktop ≥1440px before/after" or false]
- verified_by: [list of task IDs in the verification phase that sign off this AC]
```

For the full AC schema reference and examples, see `./references/ac-schema.md`.

## Best Practices

### File Size Management

**Guideline**: No file should exceed ~800 lines

**Rationale**:
- Optimal token efficiency for AI context loading
- Enables progressive disclosure pattern
- Reduces cognitive load for agents
- Faster file parsing and analysis

**Strategies**:
1. Break plans by phase when >800 lines
2. Group short related phases (1-3, 4-5)
3. Keep summaries in parent, details in phase files
4. Use links for cross-references

### Naming Conventions

**PRDs**: `[feature-name]-v1.md`
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Include version number (-v1, -v2)
- Descriptive name (e.g., `advanced-filtering-v1.md`)

**Implementation Plans**: `[feature-name]-v1.md`
- Match PRD naming
- Same category as PRD
- Version synchronized with PRD

**Phase Files**: `phase-[N]-[name].md`
- Sequential numbering (phase-1, phase-2)
- Can group: `phase-1-3-backend.md`
- Descriptive name (database, repository, frontend)

### Directory Organization

**PRDs**:
- `docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/`
- Categories: `harden-polish`, `features`, `enhancements`, `refactors`

**Implementation Plans**:
- `docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/`
- Match PRD category
- Phase breakouts in subdirectory: `[plan-name]/`

### Token Efficiency Tips

**Progressive Disclosure**:
1. Summary in parent plan (200 lines)
2. Link to detailed phase files (400 lines each)
3. Agent loads summary first, then specific phase as needed
4. 50-67% token reduction

**Structured References**:
- Link to ADRs instead of duplicating architecture info
- Reference existing docs rather than repeating
- Use relative paths for phase file links

**Chunk by Logical Units**:
- Keep related tasks together
- Don't split mid-phase
- Group short phases if logical
- Maintain quality gates with phases

## Examples

### Example 1: Create PRD for Advanced Filtering

**Input**:
```
User: "Create a PRD for adding advanced filtering to the prompts page. Users need to filter by multiple criteria: model, provider, date range, tags, and favorites."
```

**Process**:
1. Extract feature name: "Advanced Filtering"
2. Determine category: "features"
3. Generate PRD using template
4. Structure sections:
   - Problem: Users can only filter by single criteria
   - Goals: Multi-criteria filtering, saved filter sets
   - Requirements: UI for filter builder, backend filter query support
   - Phases: Phase 1 (Backend), Phase 2 (Frontend), Phase 3 (Saved Filters)

**Output**:
```
File: docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/advanced-filtering-v1.md

# Advanced Filtering - PRD

**Feature Name**: Advanced Filtering
**Date**: 2025-11-11
**Author**: Codex (Sonnet 4.5)
**Related**: Filtering guides, search ADRs

## 1. Executive Summary
Enable users to filter prompts by multiple criteria simultaneously (model, provider, date range, tags, favorites) with the ability to save and reuse filter sets.

## 2. Context & Background
Current filtering supports single criteria only. Users frequently need to filter by combinations (e.g., "OpenAI models from last week tagged 'production'").

```

### Example 2: Create Implementation Plan with Phase Breakout

**Input**:
```
User: "Create implementation plan for docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/advanced-filtering-v1.md"
```

**Process**:
1. Read PRD, extract requirements
2. Plan 7 phases following MP architecture
3. Generate task breakdown with estimates
4. Assign subagents to each task
5. Calculate total: 1100 lines → needs breakout
6. Create phase files:
   - phase-1-3-backend.md (500 lines)
   - phase-4-5-frontend.md (400 lines)
   - phase-6-7-validation.md (300 lines)
7. Update parent plan with links (200 lines)

**Output**:
```
Main Plan: docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/advanced-filtering-v1.md (200 lines)

# Implementation Plan: Advanced Filtering

## Phase Overview
| Phase | Title | Effort | Files |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1-3 | Backend Implementation | 18 pts | [Details](./advanced-filtering-v1/phase-1-3-backend.md) |
| 4-5 | Frontend Implementation | 12 pts | [Details](./advanced-filtering-v1/phase-4-5-frontend.md) |
| 6-7 | Validation & Deployment | 8 pts | [Details](./advanced-filtering-v1/phase-6-7-validation.md) |

... (executive summary, strategy)

---

Phase Files Created:
- advanced-filtering-v1/phase-1-3-backend.md (500 lines)
  - Phase 1: Database (filter_sets table, indexes)
  - Phase 2: Repository (query builder, filter sets repo)
  - Phase 3: Service (filter validation, DTO mapping)

- advanced-filtering-v1/phase-4-5-frontend.md (400 lines)
  - Phase 4: API (filter endpoints, saved sets API)
  - Phase 5: UI (filter builder component, saved sets UI)

- advanced-filtering-v1/phase-6-7-validation.md (300 lines)
  - Phase 6: Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Phase 7: Deployment (feature flags, monitoring)
```

### Example 3: Optimize Existing Long Plan

**Input**:
```
User: "Optimize docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/sidebar-polish-v1.md - it's 1200 lines"
```

**Process**:
1. Read plan: 8 phases, ~150 lines each
2. Determine breakout: Group 1-3 (backend), 4-5 (frontend), 6-8 (validation)
3. Create phase files:
   - phase-1-3-backend.md (450 lines)
   - phase-4-5-frontend.md (400 lines)
   - phase-6-8-validation.md (350 lines)
4. Update parent plan: Keep summary, add links to phase files (200 lines)

**Output**:
```
Updated: docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/sidebar-polish-v1.md (200 lines)

Created Phase Files:
- sidebar-polish-v1/phase-1-3-backend.md (450 lines)

Token Efficiency: 67% reduction for targeted queries
```

## Integration with Project Standards

### Architecture Compliance

All plans follow project layered architecture.

### Subagent Ecosystem

Plans integrate with 50+ project subagents:

**Architecture**: lead-architect, backend-architect, data-layer-expert
**Development**: python-backend-engineer, frontend-developer, ui-engineer-enhanced
**UI/UX**: ui-designer, ux-researcher
**Review**: code-reviewer, task-completion-validator
**Documentation**: documentation-writer, documentation-complex
**Testing**: testing specialists
**Performance**: react-performance-optimizer, web-accessibility-checker

### Documentation Policy

Follows AGENTS.md documentation policy:
- PRDs are product-planning docs (allowed)
- Implementation Plans are product-planning docs (allowed)
- NO reports, summaries, etc unless explicitly requested

### File Organization

**PRDs**: `/docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md`
**Plans**: `/docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md`
**Phase Files**: `[plan-name]/phase-[N]-[name].md`

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Templates

Edit templates in `./templates/` to match project needs:

1. **PRD Template Customization**:
   - Add project-specific sections
   - Adjust success metrics format
   - Include standard acceptance criteria

2. **Implementation Plan Template Customization**:
   - Add/remove phases
   - Adjust quality gates
   - Customize risk categories

3. **Progress Tracking Template Customization**:
   - Add project-specific status values
   - Adjust completion tracking format
   - Include team-specific metadata

### Multi-PRD Planning

For complex initiatives spanning multiple PRDs:

1. Create parent epic document
2. Generate individual PRDs for each component
3. Link PRDs to parent epic
4. Create unified progress tracking across PRDs

### Spike Integration

For research-heavy features:

1. Create SPIKE document first (using spike-writer agent)
2. Use SPIKE to inform PRD generation
3. Reference SPIKE in PRD "Context & Background"
4. Link SPIKE from Implementation Plan

### Continuous Optimization

Regularly optimize plans as work progresses:

1. Update progress tracking with actual completion
2. Adjust estimates based on learnings
3. Break out new sections if plan grows >800 lines
4. Archive completed phases
